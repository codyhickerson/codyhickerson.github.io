    <h3>He Came, He Saw, He Left.</h3>
    <p>Traveling far across the galaxy using a light sail that was powered by lazers from his home planet Excaltious, Liam came in search of a rare element. The element of Scaltium. Scaltium, acording to Liam was a very powerful metal. This metal not only produced ratiation, but also it emited light. But not just average light, this light was unique because it did not give off any excess energy. It only glowed to produce a red hue. Liam was told by his counselor that if he found this rare metal he could harness the power and create a brand new element that no one has ever seen. It could end the energy crisis which his planet unfortunately suffered from. Here are a few entries from his journal which was recovered from the accident.</p>

          <p>I did not expect much from a blue planet. This planet appeared to be covered by 75 percent water but upon approach I discovered that this was more than a blue plannet and needed to go to the surface and observe and record data. Upon touchdown I noticed a very mild climate. Nothing too warm. Nothing too cold. I began to walk around to check the radiation levels. Approx 15 min walk - no significant results. </p>

          <p>I beilieve there are cretures in the forrest surround my craft. An object hit the space craft 3 different times. It appears to be small in size. Sounds like rocks are being thrown. Not to sure what they are or what they want due to the heavy fog that has suddenly shielded my vision as well as infared cameras. Will investigate further once fog clears.</p>

          <p>Fog has appeared to clear up. I will wear the advanced HTAC suit out while investigating what was thrown at the craft.</p>

          <p>Upon return from EVA I was pleased to be greeted by radiation resistant humans. I thought humans when exting when we saw the global nuclear war that occurred in 2114 but we thought this planet was inhabited. I was wrong. They do not speak but are able to write in English or what I assumed to be English. They told me that they needed my help and asked me to come to their village just down the hill about 8 nutenflanks (alien miles) down the hill. I agreed but quickly grabbed my gun and hid it in my satchel.</p>

          <p>It was a trap. They tried to attack me with spears. Shot a few and escaped but I believe they will return with more numbers. </p>
